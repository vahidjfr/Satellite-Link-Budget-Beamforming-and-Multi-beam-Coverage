# vahidjfr-Satellite-Link-Budget-Beamforming-and-Multi-beam-Coverage

The aim of this project is to calculate the Link Budget, Beamforming, and Multi-beam Coverage with Python programming language.

Link budget: 

Compute the overall link budget assuming a transparent satellite (LEO or GEO)

select the location of both the transmitting and receiving Earth station.

Compute the link budget with and without atmospheric impairments.

And also:

i) the impact of the atmospheric impairments; ii) the impact of the onboard antenna configuration; iii) the impact of the location of the receiving Earth station (the transmitting station can be assumed at a fixed location). The system should be able to work at a carrier the frequency selected by the user, but the numerical results can be provided in Ka or Ku bands.

Beamforming

Implement a planar Phased Antenna Array (PAA) on-board a GEO or LEO satellite and evaluate the impact of the array configuration on the on-ground coverage: i) distance between the antenna radiating elements; ii) dimension of the array; iii) geometric organization of the antenna radiating elements. The rotationally invariant cosine radiating element can be used as a reference radiation pattern of the elements.

Multi-beam coverage

Implement a multi-beam on-ground coverage as per 3GPP TR 38.821 for a GEO or LEO satellite and uniformly distribute a certain number of users on-ground (this value must be configured by the user). The simulator should provide Cumulative Distribution Functions, probability density functions, maximum, minimum, and average value of the path loss and delays in the considered scenario per beam. The report should provide and discuss the numerical results comparing GEO and LEO satellites, S or Ka-band systems.
